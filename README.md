# relation-extraction
Relation Extraction with Semeval 2010 data, i2b2 2010 VA challenge classification data and DDI extraction data.

For Semeval 2010 task 8, evaluation is done based on macro F1 of all classes but not considering "Other"
For the DDI Extraction task, evaluation is done based on macro F1 of all classes (strict evaluation) as well
as macro F1 for relation detection (loose evaluation). We print macro F1 of all classes (5 way with none),
macro F1 of non 'none' classes and macro F1 of the detection.
